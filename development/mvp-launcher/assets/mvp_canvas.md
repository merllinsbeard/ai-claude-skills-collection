# MVP Canvas Template

Use this one-page template to crystallize your MVP scope and hypothesis.

## 🎯 Core Value Proposition

**One sentence that passes the "mom test":**

[Your value prop here - What problem → For whom → Why now]

Example: "Automated invoice reconciliation for small accounting firms who waste 10+ hours/week on manual matching"

---

## 👤 Target User

**Specific person, not a segment:**

- Role/Title:
- Company size/type:
- Current behavior:
- Pain point intensity (1-10):
- Budget authority (Y/N):

**How they solve it now:**

[Current alternative - this validates market exists]

**Why they'll switch:**

[Your unfair advantage - 10x better, not 10% better]

---

## ⚡ Primary User Action

**The ONE thing users must do to get value:**

[Single core action - e.g., "Upload invoice → See matched transaction"]

**Time to first value:**

[Target: <5 minutes from signup to "aha moment"]

**Success looks like:**

[Observable behavior - e.g., "User uploads 2nd invoice without prompting"]

---

## 📊 Success Metric

**Primary metric that proves hypothesis:**

[Pick ONE - examples below]

- Activation rate: X% complete core action within 24h
- Retention: X% return within 7 days
- Payment: X% pay within first use
- Engagement: X actions per user per week

**Target number:**

[Set specific target - e.g., "30% activation in first session"]

**How we'll measure:**

[Tracking method - mixpanel, postgres query, manual count]

---

## 💰 Monetization

**Pricing model:**

[ ] Subscription (monthly/annual)
[ ] Usage-based (per API call, transaction, etc.)
[ ] One-time purchase
[ ] Freemium
[ ] Transaction/marketplace fee

**Price point:**

$_____ per _____ (month/year/transaction/etc.)

**Value anchor:**

[What ROI/value does user get? Must be 10x price minimum]

---

## 🚀 Build Scope (Week 1-2)

**Must have (core value delivery):**

1. [Feature 1 - minimum to deliver value]
2. [Feature 2 - if truly essential]
3. [Payment mechanism - even if manual]

**Deliberately excluded (will add only if proven necessary):**

- [Feature X - nice to have]
- [Feature Y - premature optimization]
- [Feature Z - can be manual for first 10 users]

**Manual workarounds (do things that don't scale):**

- [Process 1 - handled manually behind scenes]
- [Process 2 - personal onboarding for early users]

---

## 🎬 Launch Plan

**Week 1-2: Build + First Users**

- Complete MVP build
- Target: 3-5 alpha users (manually recruited)
- Method: [Direct outreach, community, personal network]

**Week 3: First 10 Paying Customers**

- Manual sales, learn messaging
- User interviews daily
- Iterate based on feedback

**Week 4: Measure & Decide**

- Hit/miss on success metric?
- Retention curve flattening?
- Users demonstrating problem is real?
- Decision: Iterate / Pivot / Kill

---

## ✅ Validation Criteria (Go/No-Go)

**Signals we're onto something:**

- [ ] 40%+ activation rate
- [ ] 20%+ D7 retention
- [ ] Users asking "when can I pay?"
- [ ] Organic word-of-mouth starting
- [ ] Using it ourselves regularly

**Kill signals:**

- [ ] <10% activation after multiple iterations
- [ ] Users try once, never return
- [ ] "Nice to have" but won't pay
- [ ] We've stopped believing in it

---

## 📝 Assumptions to Test

**Riskiest assumption #1:**

[What must be true for this to work?]

Test method: [How will we validate this quickly?]

**Riskiest assumption #2:**

[Second critical assumption]

Test method: [Validation approach]

**Riskiest assumption #3:**

[Third assumption]

Test method: [Quick test]

---

## 🔄 Iteration Hypotheses

After first week, document what you're learning:

**Hypothesis 1:**

"We believe [doing X] will result in [outcome Y] because [reason Z]"

Result after test: [What happened]

**Hypothesis 2:**

"We believe [doing X] will result in [outcome Y] because [reason Z]"

Result after test: [What happened]

---

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Check yourself before wrecking yourself:

- [ ] Building for 6+ weeks before first user
- [ ] Adding features before core value proven
- [ ] Optimizing before understanding retention
- [ ] Talking to investors before customers
- [ ] Focusing on UI polish over functionality
- [ ] "One more feature and then we'll launch"

---

## 📅 Timeline Reality Check

- Day 1-7: Build core feature
- Day 8-10: First 3 alpha users
- Day 11-14: Iterate on feedback
- Day 15-21: First 10 paying customers
- Day 22-28: Measure, learn, decide

If you're taking longer, you're probably building too much.

**Ship date (commit to it):**

[Specific date - create urgency]

---

Fill this out in 30 minutes. If it takes longer, you're overthinking it.

Launch in 2 weeks. Talk to users daily. Measure ruthlessly. Iterate or pivot.
