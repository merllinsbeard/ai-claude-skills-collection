# Monetization Models Quick Reference

## Model Selection Framework

Choose based on: value delivery pattern, customer behavior, competitive landscape.

## 1. Subscription (SaaS)

**When to use:**
- Continuous value delivery
- Regular usage pattern
- Retention is core metric

**Pricing tiers:**
- **Freemium**: Free tier → conversion to paid (10-20% typical)
- **Tiered**: Good/Better/Best (anchor middle tier at 3x free value)
- **Usage-based tiers**: Pay as you grow (reduces initial friction)

**Price points (B2B SaaS):**
- Entry: $29-99/mo (prosumer, small teams)
- Mid: $199-499/mo (SMB, clear ROI)
- Enterprise: $1000+/mo (custom, volume discounts)

**Annual billing strategy:**
- 2 months free standard (16% discount)
- Improves cash flow and retention
- Require annual for enterprise

## 2. Usage-Based (Consumption)

**When to use:**
- Variable usage patterns
- Value directly tied to consumption
- "Pay for what you use" resonates

**Examples:**
- API calls (per 1000 requests)
- Storage (per GB)
- Credits/tokens system
- Transaction volume

**Advantages:**
- Lower entry barrier
- Scales with customer growth
- Natural expansion revenue

**Risks:**
- Revenue volatility
- Complex pricing communication
- Requires good usage monitoring

## 3. Transaction/Marketplace

**When to use:**
- Facilitate transactions between parties
- Value = successful completion
- Network effects exist

**Take rates:**
- Digital goods: 15-30%
- Services marketplace: 10-20%
- B2B transactions: 1-5%

**Hybrid model:**
- Transaction fee + subscription (guaranteed revenue floor)
- Example: Stripe (2.9% + $0.30) + monthly platform fee

## 4. One-Time Purchase

**When to use:**
- Discrete value delivery
- Low ongoing costs
- Lifetime access makes sense

**Price anchoring:**
- Entry: $9-29 (impulse buy)
- Mid: $49-199 (considered purchase)
- Premium: $299-999 (must justify ROI)

**Upgrade path:**
- Major versions (v1 → v2)
- Add-ons and extensions
- Priority support tier

## 5. Freemium

**When to use:**
- Viral growth potential
- Word-of-mouth critical
- Free tier creates network effects

**Conversion triggers:**
- Usage limits (API calls, storage, seats)
- Feature gates (advanced functionality)
- Support/SLA requirements

**Success metrics:**
- 2-5% conversion = okay
- 5-10% = good
- 10%+ = excellent

**Anti-pattern:**
- Free tier too generous (no pressure to upgrade)
- Paid tier not compelling enough

## 6. Hybrid Models

### Subscription + Usage
- Base platform fee + usage overages
- Example: $99/mo + $0.01 per extra API call
- Predictable base + scales with value

### Freemium + Transaction
- Free to use, take cut of revenue
- Example: Shopify (subscription + transaction fees)

### Tiered + Usage Pooling
- Different tiers with included usage
- Example: $49/mo (10k credits) → $199/mo (100k credits)

## Pricing Psychology

### Value-Based Pricing
- Price on customer value received, not cost to deliver
- What's the ROI/value multiple? (10x minimum)
- Competitive alternatives set ceiling

### Anchoring Effects
- Show higher price first (annual vs monthly)
- Position middle tier as "most popular"
- Display savings percentage

### Price Experimentation
- A/B test pricing (if traffic allows)
- Grandfather existing customers on old pricing
- Test 2x increase on new cohorts (most founders underprice)

## Red Flags

**Pricing too low:**
- Can't afford customer acquisition
- Signals low value perception
- Attracts wrong customer segment

**Pricing too complex:**
- Users confused = won't buy
- Sales cycle lengthens
- Support burden increases

**No monetization MVP:**
- Must charge from day 1
- Even beta users should pay something
- Free = no validation that problem matters

## Quick Decision Tree

1. **Continuous value + retention model?** → Subscription
2. **Variable usage patterns?** → Usage-based or hybrid
3. **Facilitate transactions?** → Marketplace/transaction
4. **One-time delivery?** → One-time purchase
5. **Need viral growth?** → Freemium with conversion path

## Benchmarks by Business Model

**SaaS (subscription):**
- Monthly churn: <5% good, <3% excellent
- LTV:CAC: ≥3:1 minimum, 5:1+ great
- CAC payback: <12 months
- Annual contract value: $5k-50k (SMB), $100k+ (enterprise)

**Usage-based:**
- Revenue growth rate: 100%+ Year 1-3
- Net revenue retention: 120%+ (expansion > churn)
- Gross margin: 70%+ (scaling costs with usage)

**Marketplace:**
- Take rate: 10-20% standard
- Gross margin: 60-80% (after payment processing)
- Supply-side retention: Key metric (harder to replace)
