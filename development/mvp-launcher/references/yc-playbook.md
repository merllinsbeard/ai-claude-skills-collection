# Y Combinator Startup Playbook

Distilled principles from YC partners, essays, and startup school.

## Core Philosophy

**"Make something people want"** - Paul Graham

The only thing that matters is building something a small number of users love, not something a large number of users like.

## Idea Selection

### Good Idea Characteristics:
1. **You want it yourself** (founder-market fit)
2. **You can build MVP quickly** (<2 weeks ideal)
3. **Few but desperate users** (not many meh users)
4. **Recently became possible** (timing)
5. **Proximate to existing behavior** (low adoption friction)

### Red Flags:
- "This would be cool" (not a burning problem)
- Requires behavior change to work
- "Everyone could use this" (too broad = no one cares urgently)
- "We'll figure out monetization later" (business model unclear)
- Solving a problem you don't have

### The Mom Test:
Don't ask: "Would you use this?"
Ask: "How do you currently solve X? How much time/money do you spend on it?"

## MVP Principles

**Launch in days/weeks, not months.**

### What to Include:
- One core feature that delivers value
- Way to take payment (even if manual)
- Minimal viable quality (can be embarrassingly simple)

### What to Exclude:
- Everything else
- Polish and perfection
- Scalability concerns (for now)
- Features users "might want"

**"Do things that don't scale"** - Paul Graham

Manual everything initially:
- Onboard users personally
- Do customer support via text/DM
- Manually trigger processes
- Write code that only works for first 10 users

Why: Learn what users actually need before automating.

## Growth Pre-PMF

**Talk to users. Every. Single. Day.**

### User Interview Cadence:
- Week 1-4: 5+ interviews per week
- Month 2-6: 3+ interviews per week
- Always: Respond to every piece of feedback

### Questions to Ask:
1. "What were you doing right before using our product?"
2. "What would you do if our product disappeared?"
3. "What almost stopped you from signing up?"
4. "When do you use it? Why then?"
5. "Have you recommended it? To whom? What did you say?"

### Distribution Before Product-Market Fit:

**Do not:**
- Build growth team
- Run paid ads
- Hire salespeople
- Optimize funnels

**Do:**
- Manually recruit first 100 users
- Go where your users are (communities, events, DMs)
- Get users one-by-one
- Focus on retention, not acquisition

## Product-Market Fit Detection

**"You'll know when you have it"** - Marc Andreessen

### Strong Signals:
- Organic word-of-mouth happening
- Users get upset when product is down
- Usage becoming habitual (weekly+)
- Pulling product would disappoint segment
- Hiring can't keep up with inbound demand

### False Signals:
- Press coverage
- Award nominations
- User growth (without retention/engagement)
- Investor interest
- Revenue (if churn is high)

### The "Would you be very disappointed" test:
Survey users: "How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?"
- >40% "very disappointed" = PMF exists
- 25-40% = on the path
- <25% = not there yet

## Common Founder Mistakes

### 1. Building Too Long Before Launching
**Fix:** Launch embarrassingly early. Get feedback day 1.

### 2. Not Talking to Users
**Fix:** Set daily calendar reminder. 30min user calls.

### 3. Focusing on Wrong Metrics
**Fix:** Retention > acquisition. Revenue > traffic.

### 4. Hiring Too Early
**Fix:** Stay small until PMF. Founders should do sales/support.

### 5. Fundraising Before PMF
**Fix:** Raise only if needed. Traction > pitch deck.

### 6. Building for Imaginary Users
**Fix:** Design for specific person you've talked to.

### 7. Ignoring Unit Economics
**Fix:** Calculate LTV:CAC from first paid user.

### 8. Death by 1000 Features
**Fix:** Remove features, don't add. Less surface area = faster iteration.

## Pivoting Guidance

**When to pivot:**
- No organic growth after 3-6 months of real trying
- Talking to users reveals they don't have the problem
- You've stopped using the product yourself
- Team has better idea they believe in more

**How to pivot:**
- Keep talking to same users (insight remains)
- Pivot to adjacent problem in same space
- Test new hypothesis fast (days not weeks)
- Don't throw away code/learnings unnecessarily

**Pivot types:**
1. Customer segment (same product, different buyer)
2. Problem (different pain point for same customer)
3. Solution (different approach to same problem)
4. Business model (same product, different monetization)

## Focus Ruthlessly

**"Startups die from doing too many things, not too few"**

### The One Thing Exercise:
Each week, what is THE ONE THING that moves needle?
- If blocked, what's preventing it?
- Everything else is distraction until this is solved

### Time Allocation (Pre-PMF):
- 60%: Building core product
- 30%: Talking to users
- 10%: Everything else (fundraising, press, admin)

### Say No To:
- Conferences (unless users are there)
- Press opportunities (vanity, no users)
- Enterprise sales before SMB works
- Features requested by non-customers
- Optimization before core workflow works
- Building for "what if we get big" scenarios

## Iteration Speed

**Speed is your only advantage vs incumbents.**

### Weekly Cycle:
- Monday: What are we shipping this week?
- Wednesday: Mid-week check-in
- Friday: Ship + user feedback review

### Deployment Cadence:
- Daily deploys minimum (after basic testing)
- Break things, fix fast
- Perfect is the enemy of shipped

### Decision Making:
- Reversible decisions: Make them fast (most decisions)
- Irreversible decisions: Think more, but still decide quickly
- "Let's discuss next week" = death by committee

## Team & Culture

### Early Team Principles:
- Cofounder > solo (ideally technical + business)
- Keep team small (<5 people pre-PMF)
- Everyone talks to users
- Everyone ships code or equivalent
- Avoid remote if possible (pre-PMF communication is critical)

### Role of Founders:
1. **CEO:** Vision, fundraising, key hires, culture
2. **CTO/Technical cofounder:** Build product, technical decisions
3. **(Optional) Sales/Growth cofounder:** Customer acquisition, partnerships

**Both founders should be involved in product and users.**

### Equity Splits:
- Cofounder split: Equal or near-equal (40-50% each)
- Early employees: 0.5-2% (based on timing and role)
- Advisors: 0.1-0.5% (over 2-4 years)

**Vesting:** 4 years, 1 year cliff, for everyone including founders

## Fundraising Guidance

### When to Raise:
- Need cash to survive next 18-24 months
- Traction exists (growth, revenue, or strong engagement)
- Can articulate clear use of funds

### When NOT to Raise:
- No traction yet (build more first)
- Haven't launched (launch first)
- "Everyone else is raising" (wrong reason)
- To pay yourself comfortable salary (stay lean)

### Seed Round (2025):
- Typical: $500k - $2M
- Valuation: $5M - $15M (highly variable)
- Dilution: 10-20% of company
- Runway: 18-24 months

### Fundraising Process:
1. Build deck (10-15 slides max)
2. Get warm intros to target investors
3. Parallel process (meet 20-30 investors in 2-3 weeks)
4. Create urgency with rolling close
5. Close and get back to building

**Fundraising takes 4-6 weeks of founder time. Minimize this.**

## Pricing Strategy

**Most founders underprice by 2-5x.**

### Principles:
- Charge from day 1 (even beta users)
- Value-based pricing, not cost-plus
- Price on ROI delivered, not hours worked
- Higher price = better customers (less support, faster decisions)

### Price Testing:
- Start higher than comfortable
- Easiest to discount than raise prices later
- If no one complains about price, you're too cheap
- Grandfather existing users when raising prices

### B2B SaaS Guideline:
- Start: $50-200/mo
- If solving urgent problem: 2-5x that
- Enterprise: $1000+/mo (but add manual sales process)

## Key Metrics to Track

### Pre-PMF:
- Weekly active users (WAU)
- Retention (D1, D7, D30)
- Activation rate (signup → value)
- Qualitative feedback themes

### Post-PMF:
- MRR growth rate
- CAC by channel
- LTV:CAC ratio
- Churn rate (gross and net)
- NPS score

## Mental Models

### 1. "Make something people want" (not what you think they want)
### 2. "Do things that don't scale" (initially)
### 3. "Launch fast and iterate" (not build in secret)
### 4. "Focus on retention, not acquisition" (pre-PMF)
### 5. "Talk to users" (constantly)
### 6. "Move fast, don't optimize early" (speed > perfection)
### 7. "One thing at a time" (ruthless prioritization)
