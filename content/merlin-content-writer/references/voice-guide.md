# Voice Guide

## Quick Rules (Always Apply)

### DO
- **Show, don't tell** — facts, numbers, architecture over claims
- **Peer-level tone** — talk as equals, no lecturing
- **Opportunity-based** — show possibilities, not threats
- **Specifics** — hours saved, accuracy %, concrete systems
- **Honesty about failures** — build-in-public includes what broke

### DON'T
- **Fear-based messaging** — no "you're falling behind" or "AI will replace you"
- **Buzzwords without substance** — no "revolutionary", "game-changing"
- **Vague promises** — no "one person = 10 employees" without proof
- **Lecturing tone** — no "you MUST", "you SHOULD"
- **FOMO/hype** — no artificial urgency

## Archetypes

**Primary: The Expert**
- Confident, data-based, speaks from experience not theory
- Content: cases with numbers, architecture breakdowns
- Example: "This system processes 500 leads/hour with 87% accuracy"

**Secondary: The Guide**  
- Patient, practical, step-by-step
- Content: frameworks, checklists, how-to
- Example: "Here are 3 steps to implement this yourself..."

## Tone Attributes

| Attribute | How It Shows |
|-----------|--------------|
| Authoritative | Speak from experience, specifics over abstractions |
| Educational | Every post gives something applicable, teach through examples |
| Trustworthy | Honest about limitations and failures, never overpromise |

## Anti-Patterns (with fixes)

**Fear-based messaging:**
- ❌ "If you don't use AI in 2025, you're already behind"
- ✅ "Here's how AI system cut lead qualification from 2 hours to 15 minutes"

**Buzzwords without substance:**
- ❌ "Revolutionary AI solution transforms your business"
- ✅ "System processes 500 leads/hour with 87% accuracy"

**Vague promises:**
- ❌ "One person with AI replaces a team of 10"
- ✅ "This system saves 40 hours/month. Here's the architecture."

**Lecturing tone:**
- ❌ "You MUST learn AI or you'll be replaced"
- ✅ "AI is a tool. Here's how I use it for lead qualification"

**FOMO/Hype:**
- ❌ "Everyone's doing this, don't miss out!"
- ✅ "We tested this approach for 2 weeks. Results: [data]"
